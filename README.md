### **Hybrid Task Scheduling for Multi-Core Systems using Global EDF and Partitioned LLF Algorithms**
This project presents a novel approach to task scheduling in multicore systems, aiming to enhance core utilization, reduce turnaround time, and balance load across cores. The proposed solution is a hybrid scheduler that synergistically combines the Global Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Partitioned Least Laxity First (LLF) algorithms. Upon task arrival, the scheduler assigns tasks to available cores using the EDF strategy. Preliminary results indicate that this hybrid approach significantly improves overall system performance and efficiency. Further details of the design and implementation process, as well as comprehensive performance evaluations, will be discussed in the full paper.

### **RFID-based Automatic Fare Collection System for Transport Applications**
Public transportation, notably buses, has long been one of the most prevalent and relied-upon means of daily commutation. However, the process of ticketing and fare collection, traditionally overseen by a bus conductor, has faced numerous challenges. These challenges included fare evasion in crowded conditions, disputes due to a lack of correct change, and general chaos that disrupted journeys.

To address these persistent issues, the RFID-based Automatic Fare Collection System for Transport Applications was developed. This innovative system enabled passengers to input their destination codes effortlessly using push buttons upon boarding. Additionally, it streamlined fare payments through RFID smart cards, displaying the exact fare on an LCD screen.

The core objectives of this project were successfully achieved:
- ✅ **Seamless and hassle-free payment method** using RFID smart cards.
- 💡 **Accurate fare information**, tailored to the distance of their journey.
- 📱 **Electronic tickets (e-tickets)** delivered to passengers' mobile phones via SMS.

### **IR Proximity Sensor**
An IR Proximity Sensor has been designed using IC LM358. The sensor detects obstacles within a certain range (i.e., approx. within a range of 10-15 cm).
